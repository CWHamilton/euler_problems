# Project Euler
Welcome to my Project Euler python practice.  

You can find my solutions to euler problems in [the problems folder](problems/euler.py).

They can also be run from terminal using pytest.

### Running Tests 

`pytest -m euler`

Use `--run_slow` to include some problems that take a while to run.
