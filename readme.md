# Project Euler
Welcome to my Project Euler python practice.  

You can find my solutions to euler problems in [the problems folder](problems/euler.py).

They can also be run from terminal using pytest.

### Running Tests 

`pytest -m euler`

Add `-v` for more logging or `-q` for no logging.

Use `--duration #` to list tests that take longer than # seconds to run.

### Slow Tests
I have marked any problem that takes more than 2 seconds to run as slow.

Use `--run_slow` to include those problems in the test run.
